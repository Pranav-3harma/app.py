# PranavCrypt - Multi-Algorithm Cryptographic Application

A comprehensive Python web application demonstrating four modern cryptographic algorithms: RSA, AES, ChaCha20, and Blowfish.

## Features

- **Four Cryptographic Algorithms:**
  - **RSA**: Asymmetric encryption with 2048-bit keys and hybrid encryption

  - **ChaCha20**: High-performance stream cipher with 256-bit keys
  - **Blowfish**: Fast block cipher with 448-bit keys and CBC mode

- **Interactive Web Interface:**
  - Clean, responsive Bootstrap 5 design
  - Algorithm selection with detailed descriptions
  - Key generation for asymmetric algorithms
  - Real-time encryption and decryption
  - Base64 encoded output for easy sharing

- **Security Features:**
  - No persistent storage of keys or messages
  - Cryptographically secure random number generation
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Secure session management

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Encrypt/Decrypt page**
2. **Select an algorithm** from the dropdown menu
3. **Generate keys** (for RSA and ECC) or use auto-generated keys (for AES and ChaCha20)
4. **Enter your message** in the encryption tab
5. **Click Encrypt** to see the encrypted result
6. **Switch to the Decrypt tab** to decrypt the data

### Algorithm-Specific Instructions

#### RSA
- Generate public/private key pair
- Use public key for encryption
- Use private key for decryption
- Supports hybrid encryption for large messages

#### AES
- Keys are auto-generated if not provided
- Uses AES-256-CBC mode with random IV
- Same key required for encryption and decryption

#### ChaCha20
- Keys are auto-generated if not provided
- High-performance stream cipher
- Same key required for encryption and decryption

#### Blowfish
- Keys are auto-generated if not provided
- Uses Blowfish in CBC mode with 8-byte IV
- 448-bit key for maximum security
- Same key required for encryption and decryption

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Disclaimer**: This application is designed for educational and demonstration purposes only. While it implements proper cryptographic algorithms, it should not be used for securing sensitive production data.

### Best Practices
- Use for educational purposes only
- Never use generated keys for production systems
- Keep private keys secure and never share them
- Use strong, unique keys for each operation
- Verify data integrity before decryption

### Data Protection
- No persistent storage of keys or messages
- All operations performed in memory
- Automatic cleanup after operations
- Secure session management
